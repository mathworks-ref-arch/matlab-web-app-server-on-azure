# MATLAB Web App Server on Microsoft Azure

# Requirements

Before starting, you need the following:

-   A MATLAB® Web App Server™ license. To configure a license for use on the cloud, you must obtain the MAC address of the network license manager after deployment to the cloud. For details, see [Configure MATLAB Web App Server Licensing on the Cloud](https://www.mathworks.com/help/webappserver/ug/configure-server-license-on-cloud.html).
-   A Microsoft Azure™ account.

# Costs
You are responsible for the cost of the Azure services used when you create cloud resources using this guide. Resource settings, such as instance type, affect
the cost of deployment. For cost estimates, see the pricing pages for each Azure
service you are using. Prices are subject to change.


# Introduction 

Use this guide to automate the process of running MATLAB Web App Server on Azure using your Azure account. The automation is accomplished using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. The template is a JSON file that defines the resources needed to deploy and manage MATLAB Web App Server on Azure. For information about the architecture of this solution, see [Architecture and Resources](#architecture-and-resources).

Deploying MATLAB Web App Server on Azure automatically deploys a network license manager. However, you can also use an existing network license manager with MATLAB Web App Server on Azure by selecting `existing` from the deployment template.

# Deploy Reference Architecture for Your Release
To deploy the reference architecture, select your MATLAB Web App Server release from the table and follow the instructions to deploy the server using the provided template.

> [!WARNING]
> \*When the server is configured to use MATLAB Runtime versions prior to R2023b, the `unsafe-inline` attribute is set in the `script-src` directive of the server's Content Security Policy on the server and cannot be removed. The attribute allows inline JavaScript execution and event handlers contained within a web app to execute on the server. These runtimes are disabled by default in R2024b. You can enable them using the [webapps-runtime](https://www.mathworks.com/help/webappserver/ref/webappsruntime.html) command.

MathWorks provides templates for only the six most recent releases of MATLAB Web App Server. Earlier templates are removed and are no longer supported.

# Architecture and Resources
Deploying this reference architecture creates several resources in your
resource group.

## How do I configure OIDC authentication?
1. To use OIDC authentication on the server, you need to register with an IdP such as Microsoft® Azure® AD, or Google® Identity Platform. MATLAB Web App Server must be registered as an application with the IdP.
1. During the registration process, you need a redirect URL for MATLAB Web App Server. The format of the URL is: `https://<MATLABWebAppServer_hostname>:<port_server_is_running_on>/webapps/extauth/callback`. For example: `https://example.com:9988/webapps/extauth/callback`.
1. Create a file named `webapps_authn.json` using the JSON schema specified [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/webappserver/ug/authentication.html#mw_908077ba-725e-4cc9-a906-a1bf29fceaf8) and place it in the `webapps_private` folder of the server. For folder location, see the [doc](https://www.mathworks.com/help/webappserver/ug/authentication.html#mw_146e67b0-5dff-4310-8d5d-544250e931a9).
1. To place the `webapps_authn.json` file in the `webapps_private` folder of the server, you need to remotely connect to the server using RDP on Windows or SCP on Linux. Once connected, you can drag-and-drop the `webapps_authn.json` file you created into the `webapps_private` folder of the server. Alternatively, you can drop the file into the file share first, before moving it to the `webapps_private` folder.
1. Restart the server by executing `webapps-restart` from a terminal on the the server machine. The `webapps-restart` command is located in the `script` folder within the default installation location. For default location, see the [doc](https://www.mathworks.com/help/webappserver/ug/set-up-matlab-web-app-server.html#responsive_offcanvas).
